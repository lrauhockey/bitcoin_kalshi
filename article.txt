Recently, I was doom scrolling on X when out of nowhere I came across a post that made me stop and stare because a trader with the username “ascetic0x” had somehow turned $12 into $100,000 in just 16 bets. Now here’s the thing, he wasn’t trading some random altcoin or using crazy leverage on futures like most people who chase these kinds of gains.

Instead, he was betting on whether Bitcoin would go up or down in 15 minute windows on a platform called Polymarket, and once I saw this, I knew I had to understand exactly how it worked.

So I spent hours going through every detail I could find about his trades, his strategy, and the platform itself, and what I’m about to share with you is everything I learned about what he did, how he did it, and how you might be able to try something similar yourself.

What These 15 Minute Bitcoin Markets Actually Are
So let me break this down for you because it’s actually simpler than it sounds. Polymarket has this type of bet called a 15 minute Bitcoin Up/Down market, and each bet asks one straightforward question: will Bitcoin be higher or lower at the end of a 15 minute period compared to where it started?

That’s literally it, and there are no complex options or leverage mechanics to worry about because you just pick “Up” or “Down” and put your money in.

Now here’s how the betting actually works in practice. You buy what are called shares, and each share costs somewhere between $0.01 and $0.99 depending on what the market thinks is going to happen. The price of the share basically shows you what everyone else believes the chances are, so if “Down” shares cost $0.40, the market is collectively saying there’s about a 40% chance Bitcoin goes down in that window.

And this is where it gets interesting because if you buy at $0.40 and you turn out to be right, you get $1 back, which means you just made 2.5 times your money on a single bet. But here’s the catch, if you’re wrong, you lose everything you put in because the share goes straight to zero.

The way they determine who wins is actually pretty clever and completely automatic. The results come from something called a Chainlink price feed, which is basically a system that pulls Bitcoin prices from big exchanges like Binance and Coinbase and combines them into one official number.

At the end of each 15 minute window, the system checks where Bitcoin ended up, and if it’s the same or higher than where it started, “Up” wins, but if Bitcoin is even slightly lower, “Down” wins. What I really like about this setup is that there’s no human deciding the outcome, so you don’t have to worry about anyone manipulating the results.

Now I should mention that these markets do have fees, but only on these short term crypto bets since most other Polymarket markets are completely free to trade. The fee changes based on the share price, and when you buy shares at $0.50, the fee is at its highest point of about 1.56%, but when you buy shares close to $0.01 or $0.99, the fee drops to almost nothing.

To put this in perspective, Polymarket gives an example in their documents showing that if you spend $50 buying 100 shares at $0.50 each, you pay about $0.78 in fees, which isn’t huge but definitely adds up over time.

And here’s something that makes this really exciting for anyone looking to grow their money quickly. There are 96 of these 15 minute windows every single day, which means 96 separate chances to place a bet.

If you keep winning and keep putting all your money into the next bet, your balance can grow extremely fast through what’s called compounding, but I want to be upfront with you that this is also incredibly risky because one single loss wipes out everything you’ve built up.

How He Actually Made So Much Money So Fast
So now that you understand the basics, let me tell you exactly what this trader did because his approach was about as aggressive as it gets. He went all in on every single bet without exception, meaning he took his entire balance and put it all on one side of the next 15 minute market.

When he won, he took all of that money and did the exact same thing again with the next window, and he just kept repeating this process over and over.

To give you a sense of the numbers, he started with about $12, and after 11 correct bets in a row, he had nearly $30,000 sitting in his account. But he didn’t stop there, and in another run, he got 16 correct bets in a row which is when he ended up with about $100,000.

The math behind this actually makes perfect sense when you see the multipliers involved because when you buy shares around $0.40 to $0.50, you roughly double your money or a bit more each time you win, and if you keep doubling $12 over 16 consecutive wins, you end up with these massive numbers.

One step in his run really shows how powerful this compounding effect can be. He put all $11,200 of his balance on “Yes” shares at $0.43 each, and when he won that bet, he got back over $29,000, which works out to about 2.3 times his bet on a single 15 minute trade. And the key thing to understand is that he never stopped to take profits or celebrate, he just immediately rolled everything into the next bet.

What made his strategy so explosive was that he never split his money between different bets or kept some on the side for safety. Every single win became the full stake for the next bet, and this is absolutely the most aggressive way to grow money in any kind of trading or betting environment.

But I want you to understand the flip side too, because this is also the fastest way to lose everything since any single wrong guess at any point would have taken his entire account to zero instantly.

What Information He Used To Make His Decisions
Now here’s where it gets really interesting because he wasn’t just guessing randomly or going with his gut feeling on each bet. The reports about his trades consistently say he used real data from the crypto markets to inform every decision he made, and he specifically looked at things like order books, funding rates, liquidation numbers, and breaking news.

By combining all of this information together, he could make educated guesses about whether Bitcoin was more likely to go up or down in the next 15 minutes.

Order Book Depth
So let me explain what order books are and why they matter for something like this. An order book basically shows you all the buy orders and sell orders waiting to happen on an exchange at any given moment, and when you look at it, you can see exactly where big money is positioned.

Large buy orders sitting just below the current price are called bid walls, while large sell orders sitting just above the current price are called ask walls, and these walls have a real effect on where the price can actually go in the short term.

The way I think about it is that a big bid wall below the price acts like a floor that can stop the price from falling because there’s so much buying pressure waiting there, and a big ask wall above the price acts like a ceiling that can stop the price from rising because there’s so much selling pressure waiting at that level.

For a 15 minute bet, these walls matter a ton because you’re only trying to predict a very short period of time.

So practically speaking, if there’s a strong bid wall below the current price and no major ask wall above, the price is more likely to stay flat or drift upward, which would favor betting “Up.” On the other hand, if there’s a strong ask wall above and buyers look weak below, the price is more likely to stall out or drop, which would favor betting “Down.”

According to the reports about his trades on X, he watched these walls on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase and used them as one of his main tools for picking which side to bet on.

Funding Rates
Now this next part might sound a bit technical at first, but stick with me because it’s actually a really useful signal once you understand it. Funding rates are basically payments that happen between traders on perpetual futures exchanges, and they exist to keep the futures price close to the actual spot price of Bitcoin.

If the funding rate is positive, it means traders who are long have to pay traders who are short, and this tells you something important because it means too many people are betting on the price going up. When a market is too crowded on one side like this, it becomes fragile and can snap back the other way very quickly, so high positive funding suggests there’s an increased chance of a quick drop.

The opposite is also true, and if the funding rate is negative, it means traders who are short have to pay traders who are long, which tells you too many people are betting on the price going down. When you see high negative funding, it means there’s a higher chance of a quick bounce upward because all those shorts are vulnerable to getting squeezed.

What this trader did was watch funding rates to see which side was overcrowded at any given moment, and when funding was at an extreme compared to recent history, he knew that side was fragile and likely to get punished. He combined this with his other signals to pick which way to bet, and it gave him an edge in understanding the short term dynamics of the market.

Liquidation Data
This is another piece of the puzzle that really helped him make his decisions, and it’s all about understanding who just got hurt in the market. Liquidations happen when traders using leverage get forced out of their positions by the exchange, and this can happen in two ways.

If the price drops and a leveraged long position loses too much money, the exchange closes it automatically, and that’s called a long liquidation. If the price rises and a leveraged short position loses too much money, the exchange closes that automatically too, and that’s called a short liquidation.

So why does this matter for a 15 minute bet? Well, liquidation data tells you who just got punished in the market, and this gives you clues about what might happen next. For his biggest and most profitable trade in the second run, he noticed that about $717 million in short positions had been liquidated in the past 24 hours, which was the highest number in a very long time.

What this told him was that shorts had already been squeezed out aggressively, so the fuel for more upside was basically running low and a pullback became much more likely. Based on this reasoning, he bet “Down” at $0.49 per share and turned about $51,000 into roughly $104,000 on that single 15 minute trade.

And this pattern works both ways, which is really useful to understand. If long liquidations are dominating after a big price drop, it means many longs have already been flushed out and the selling pressure might be done, so a bounce becomes more likely. He used these liquidation numbers consistently to understand which side had just been punished and what the market was likely to do next as a result.

News Events
I should also mention that he definitely checked the news, but he was very selective about what kind of news actually mattered for his bets. He wasn’t reading long opinion pieces or general market analysis, but instead focused only on things that could move the market right away within the next few minutes.

For his final big trade that pushed him over $100,000, he shared a Reuters article about tensions between the United States and Iran, and this kind of geopolitical news can make traders nervous very quickly and cause a sudden move to safety assets.

The way he used this news was smart because he combined it with everything else he was seeing. The liquidation data showed shorts had been squeezed hard, the price momentum was slowing down, and now there was breaking news that could create fear in the market.

All of these factors together pointed to a short term drop, so he bet “Down” and won big. The key lesson here is that he only cared about fresh headlines that could realistically affect the next 15 minutes, not long term narratives or general opinions about where Bitcoin might go over weeks or months.

What About Volume
Now you might be wondering if he used trading volume as a signal too, but the reports about his trades don’t really mention this as a main factor in his decisions. He didn’t seem to require a certain amount of volume before placing a bet, and instead his main signals were order book depth, funding rates, and liquidation data as I described above.

Volume mattered only in the sense that he wanted enough trading activity on Polymarket so he could enter and exit his positions without problems, but it wasn’t something he actively analyzed for direction. For you, this means focusing on the data he actually focused on and just making sure the markets you bet on have enough activity that you won’t have trouble trading.

How You Can Actually Try This Yourself
Now I want to be really clear with you about something before we go further. You cannot copy his luck because 16 wins in a row is extremely rare no matter how good your analysis is.

However, you absolutely can copy his process, and you can set up the same screens he used, watch the same data he watched, and follow a similar checklist before each bet to give yourself the best possible chance.

Getting Everything Set Up
So first things first, you’re going to need a Polymarket account, and this means creating a crypto wallet like MetaMask, connecting it to Polymarket, and depositing USDC on the Polygon network. The process is pretty straightforward if you’ve ever used crypto before, and even if you haven’t, there are plenty of tutorials online that walk you through each step.

When it comes to how much money to start with, you should pick an amount you are completely okay losing because that’s a real possibility with this kind of aggressive trading. This trader started with about $12, so if you’re just testing this out, there’s no reason to start with more than you can afford to lose entirely.

Second, you’re going to need access to real time data because you can’t make good decisions if you’re looking at information that’s even a few minutes old. Open a Bitcoin chart showing 1 minute or 5 minute candles on an exchange like Binance or Coinbase, or you can use TradingView which is free and works really well.

You also need to have the order book for Bitcoin open on a major exchange so you can see where the bid and ask walls are positioned at any moment. For funding rates, websites like Coinglass show you the current rates across multiple exchanges in real time, and they also have a liquidations tracker that shows how many longs and shorts have been liquidated over the past hour and the past 24 hours.

Finally, keep a news feed open somewhere, and CryptoPanic is a good option for this, or you can create a list of trusted crypto and macro news accounts on X and check it regularly.

Once you have all of that ready, go to Polymarket and find the 15 minute Bitcoin Up/Down markets, and each one will show you the current odds for “Up” and “Down” along with the price that Bitcoin needs to beat for either side to win.

What To Check Before You Place Each Bet
So here’s where we get into the actual process of making a decision, and you should do all of this about 1 to 2 minutes before the betting window closes so you have the freshest possible information to work with.

Start by looking at the recent price action over the last 30 to 60 minutes and ask yourself whether Bitcoin is in a clear uptrend, a clear downtrend, or if it’s just made a big move and is now slowing down and consolidating. This context matters because a stalling move after a big rise might signal that a drop is coming soon, while a stalling move after a big drop might signal that a bounce is on the way.

Next, check the funding rate and pay attention to where it sits relative to its recent range. If funding is at the high end of where it’s been lately, it means longs are crowded and at risk of getting punished, but if funding is at the low end, it means shorts are crowded and at risk instead.

Remember that crowded sides in the market tend to eventually get hurt, and this can happen very quickly in a 15 minute window.

After that, check the liquidation numbers for the past 24 hours and compare how many shorts got liquidated versus how many longs got liquidated. If short liquidations are much higher than long liquidations, it means shorts have been squeezed hard and the upside fuel might be running out, so a drop becomes more likely.

But if long liquidations are much higher than short liquidations, it means longs have been flushed and selling pressure might be exhausted, so a bounce becomes more likely.

Then take a look at the order book to see if there are any major walls you should know about. Is there a large bid wall below the current price that could act as support? Is there a large ask wall above the current price that could act as resistance?

Once you see these walls, combine that information with your funding and liquidation read to form your overall view. A bid wall plus negative funding plus recent long liquidations generally points toward “Up,” while an ask wall plus positive funding plus recent short liquidations generally points toward “Down.”

Don’t forget to check the news quickly to see if there’s any breaking headline that could move Bitcoin in the next few minutes. War news, exchange hacks, surprise regulations, or major ETF announcements can all cause quick moves in either direction, and you need to factor this into your decision.

Finally, compare the odds on Polymarket to your own belief about what’s likely to happen. Look at the share price for the side you want to bet on, and if you think “Down” is the right call but “Down” shares are priced at $0.50, that means the market is saying there’s only a 50% chance.

Ask yourself honestly whether your signals suggest it’s actually 60% or 65% likely, and only bet when your read is meaningfully higher than what the market already thinks.

Keep in mind that if you’re buying at $0.50, you lose about 1.56% to fees, so your edge needs to be big enough to overcome that cost over time. And when it comes to how much to bet, you have a choice to make. If you want to copy his exact style, you go all in with everything you have on every single trade, but if you want to be safer and actually survive long enough to learn, use something like 10% to 20% of your balance per bet instead.

If most of your signals line up and the odds look good, go ahead and place the bet. But if things are unclear or the signals are contradicting each other, just skip the window and wait for the next one. Remember that there are 96 windows every single day, so you don’t need to force a bet on every single one.

The Risk Is Very Real And You Need To Understand It
Now I want to talk seriously about risk because I don’t want you to go into this thinking you can easily replicate what he did. There were 3 things that made his incredible run possible, and you need to understand all of them.

The first thing was skill because he genuinely understood how to read order books, funding rates, and liquidation data in a way that gave him an edge. He could process all of this information quickly within a short 15 minute window, and he was smart enough to skip windows when he wasn’t confident about what was going to happen. This takes practice and experience to develop, and you shouldn’t expect to be good at it right away.

The second thing was his aggressive sizing because he bet 100% of his balance every single time without any hedging or diversification. This is what made the compounding so fast and allowed $12 to turn into $100,000 in just 16 trades, but it’s also what made the strategy so risky. There’s no room for error when you’re betting everything every time.

The third thing, and this is the one most people don’t want to hear, was luck. Even if every single one of his bets had a 60% chance of winning, the odds of winning 16 in a row are about 1 in 357,000. His result is a massive statistical outlier, and you should not expect to replicate it no matter how good your analysis becomes.

So here’s what you need to accept if you want to try this. If you go all in every time like he did, you will almost certainly hit a losing bet much faster than he did, and when that happens, you’re back to zero. The smarter approach for most people is to treat your starting money as already lost, use smaller bet sizes like 10% to 20% of your balance per trade, and focus on seeing if you can maintain a win rate above 50% over 50 to 100 bets.

If you can consistently win more than you lose, then you can consider increasing your size, but if you can’t, at least you didn’t lose everything in the process of finding out.

A Simple Plan To Get Started
If you want to actually try this in a structured way, here’s what I would suggest. Pick an amount of money you’re completely okay losing, whether that’s $20 or $50 or $100, and set up your screen with a Bitcoin chart, an order book view, a funding and liquidation dashboard, and a news feed all visible at the same time.

Make a rule for yourself that you only bet when all of these things are true at the same time: funding is in the top or bottom 20% of where it’s been over the past 30 days, one side of liquidations has clearly spiked in the last 24 hours, there’s a visible wall in the order book supporting your direction, no breaking news is going against your trade, and the share you want to buy is priced at $0.55 or less so you’re getting decent odds.

Start with just 10% of your balance per bet so you can survive a losing streak and actually learn from your mistakes. Keep a detailed record of every single bet you make, and write down the time, which side you picked, the share price you paid, the funding rate at the time, the liquidation numbers you saw, any news you considered, and the final result with your profit or loss.

After you’ve made 50 to 100 bets, sit down and review your records honestly. See if you actually have an edge and whether you’re winning more than you’re losing. If you’re winning more than 60% of the time, you might consider betting larger amounts, but if you’re not, you need to figure out what’s going wrong and adjust your approach or stop entirely before you lose more money.

Answers To The Questions You Probably Have
Let me wrap up by directly answering the questions that most people have after learning about this story.

How did he take advantage of the 15 minute window? He used short term data that only matters over minutes rather than days or weeks, including order book walls, funding extremes, liquidation spikes, and breaking news events. All of these things affect what happens in the next 15 minutes much more than they affect what happens next month, and he compounded his gains by rolling every win into the next bet without ever taking profits.

How do these Polymarket betting markets actually work? You buy shares that pay $1 if you’re right and $0 if you’re wrong, and the price of the share tells you what the market thinks the probability is. Polymarket uses a Chainlink price feed to automatically decide the outcome every 15 minutes, and fees apply only on these short term crypto bets at a maximum of about 1.56% when buying at $0.50.

What made him take the specific bets he took? He placed bets when multiple signals lined up at the same time. He looked for funding to show one side was crowded, liquidations to show that side had been hurt or was about to be, and order book walls to show support or resistance. Sometimes breaking news added extra confirmation to his thesis, and he combined all of this before making each decision.

Can anyone actually do what he did? Anyone can open a Polymarket account, access the same data he used, and place the same kinds of bets. But getting 16 wins in a row is something that almost nobody will ever replicate because the probability is just too low even with a real edge. What you can do is use the same process to try to make money over many bets while managing your risk properly, but you should not expect to match his exact result.

Did he use volume and news in his analysis? He definitely used news, especially for his last trade where he shared a Reuters article about geopolitical tensions as part of his reasoning for betting “Down.” He did not focus heavily on volume as a primary signal though, and his main tools were order book depth, funding rates, and liquidation data.

What did he look at before making each bet? He looked at short term Bitcoin price movement, the structure of the order book, current funding rates compared to recent history, liquidation data over the past 24 hours, any breaking news that could affect prices, and the current Polymarket odds compared to his own estimate of the probability. When everything lined up and the price offered good value, he made his bet.

A Few More Things To Keep In Mind
Before I finish, there are some practical considerations you should be aware of. Fees matter more than you might think because at $0.50, you’re losing about 1.56% on every trade, and your edge needs to be large enough to overcome that cost consistently over time.

Data quality also matters a lot because you need real time feeds that update instantly, and even slightly old data in a 15 minute window can lead to bad decisions. Time pressure is real too because 15 minutes is not a lot of time to analyze everything and make a decision, so you need to practice being fast and decisive. Emotional control becomes critical when you’re betting aggressively because all in bets create massive emotional swings, and you have to stick to your rules even when you’re feeling the pressure.
